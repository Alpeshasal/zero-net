- Alway use Burner wallet to do these type of technical tasks
- Bridge atleast 0.01 Sepolia ETH to Zero Network via this [bridge](https://bridge.zero.network/)
- Once you complete bridging to Zero Network, you are now ready to deploy contract on Zero Network

- If any of them take long time to open then try to open these in incognito tab, it will open very fast
- Enter the below command to deploy
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alpeshasal/zero-net/main/contract.sh && chmod +x contract.sh && ./contract.sh
```
- In the middle of the code, it will show something like this
```bash
